      "species": "Reginae",
      "description": "The name Hippeastrum, given to it by William Herbert, means \"Knight's-star-lily\", although precisely what Herbert meant by the name is not certain. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result of which is that the common name \"amaryllis\" is mainly used for cultivars of this genus, often sold as indoor flowering bulbs particularly at Christmas in the northern hemisphere. By contrast the generic name Amaryllis applies to bulbs from South Africa, usually grown outdoors. ",

      "description": "The leaves of this plant have fuzzy or hairy undersides and the stems are covered by the same hairs as well, hence the name \"pubescens\" or \"hairy\" of the species. This is not a characteristic that is apparent when looking at the plant from above the water though.",
